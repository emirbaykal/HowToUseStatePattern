# State Pattern with Locomotion Example

This project demonstrates how to implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) using the State Pattern in Unity.
The playerâ€™s locomotion logic (Grounded, InAir, Crouching) is represented as separate state classes, and transitions between these states are handled dynamically without using large if or switch blocks.


## Example states:

GroundedState -> can Jump, Crouch, or Fall 

InAirState -> can Land

CrouchingState -> can Stand or Jump
